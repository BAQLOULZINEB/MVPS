When I first began working on my furniture and design website, I was excited by the seemingly simple ideas I had in mind. However, as I dove deeper into the project, I quickly realized that many of these tasks were far more complex than expected. One of the biggest challenges I faced was the lack of clarity in my initial vision. It required far more attention to detail than I had anticipated. I found myself needing to spend more time refining the CSS and adjusting the color palette to ensure the design matched my expectations.
As I encountered these unexpected hurdles, I had to adjust my plan. My natural tendency toward perfectionism meant I often struggled when things didnâ€™t turn out exactly as I had imagined. This led me to make constant tweaks and changes to the design, sometimes reworking elements over and over until they aligned with my vision. Incorporating these adjustments has taken more time than I expected, but each modification has brought me closer to creating a polished and cohesive design. In the end, the challenges have pushed me to pay more attention to the finer details and have improved my skills in web development and design .
